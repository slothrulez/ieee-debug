# IEEE DEBUG

## About the Project

This repository contains a corrected version of a previously buggy website. The original website suffered from several issues that hindered its functionality and user experience. I thoroughly debugged and fixed these problems, transforming it into a fully functional and responsive website.

## Original Issues

1. **Non-functional Buttons or Links**  
   - Several buttons and links were not working as expected. These have been debugged, and their actions are now functional.

2. **JavaScript Errors**  
   - The console showed multiple JavaScript errors due to broken scripts and missing elements. These errors have been resolved, ensuring smooth functionality.

3. **Integration Issues**  
   - APIs and third-party services failed to load or function. I fixed configuration errors and ensured all integrations are now working seamlessly.

4. **Unresponsive Design**  
   - The website layout broke on smaller screens. I applied responsive design techniques to make it mobile-friendly and adaptable to various screen sizes.

5. **Form Validation**  
   - Forms lacked validation, allowing incorrect or incomplete inputs. I implemented robust client-side and server-side validation.

6. **Styling Problems**  
   - CSS inconsistencies led to overlapping and misaligned elements. These have been corrected for a polished and professional appearance.
